<br>
        <p style="color:white">
            <b>Pre-Workout Supplements</b><br>
<br>
            Pre-workout supplements are designed to provide energy and aid endurance throughout a workout.<br>
            They are typically taken 15-30 minutes before a workout, but can also be consumed during exercise.<br>
             Below are common ingredients found in pre-workout supplements that the Academy of Nutrition<br> 
             and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine have highlighted<br>
             as having evidence-based uses in sports nutrition.<br>
             These supplements have also been categorized as apparently safe and having strong evidence<br> 
             to support efficacy by the International Society of Sports Nutrition.<br>
<br>
             <b>Beta-Alanine</b>
              Beta-alanine is an amino acid that is produced in the liver and also found in fish, poultry, and meat.<br>
              When dosed at 4–6g/day for 2–4 weeks, this supplement has been shown to improve exercise performance,<br>
               particularly for high-intensity exercise lasting 1–4 minutes, such as high-intensity<br>
                interval training (HIIT) or short sprints. It has also been shown to reduce neuromuscular fatigue,<br>
                 particularly in older adults.<br>
<br>
             <b>Caffeine</b>
             Caffeine is a stimulant that is often included in pre-workout supplements, as it has been shown to benefit<br>
             athletic performance for short-term high intensity exercise and endurance-based activities.<br>
              It is important to understand that these studies have been conducted with Olympic and competition athletes,<br>
               and thus the average individual who exercises recreationally should consult with a doctor before<br>
                using caffeine as a supplement.<br>
<br>
           <b>Creatine</b>
           Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in skeletal muscle that is synthesized in the body from amino <br>
           acids and can be obtained from red meat and seafood. In the body,it helps produce adenosine triphosphate<br>
            which provides energy for muscles. Creatine is a popular workout supplement marketed to <br>
            increase athletic performance, especially for weight training. Research suggests that creatine supplementation.<br>
